# All In one admin script for FiveM
Hello, this is a Work In Project script for Fivem.
The goal is to provide a all in one solution for FiveM servers with multiple features and a greate UI (I hope)
For the moment I do not have any Models, i'll make them soon with Figma.

In the meantime, here's an overview of all the features I want to implement:

### Frameworks compatibility
- [ ] ESX
- [ ] QBox
- [ ] ND_Core

### Inventories
- [ ] ox_inventory
- [ ] codem-inventory
- [ ] qasar-inventory

*And others if I can*

### Features

  - [ ] Heal
  - [ ] Revive
  - [ ] Goto, bring, **return**
  - [ ] See health & armor
  - [ ] Freeze
